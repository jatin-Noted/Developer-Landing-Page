                <p class="text">Back-end developers are the experts who build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions on websites. Unlike front-end developers, who control everything you can see on a website, back-end developers are involved in data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see. <br>
                A back-end developerâ€™s main responsibility is to use various tools, frameworks, and languages to determine how best to develop intuitive, user-friendly prototypes and turn them into websites. This requires an understanding of cross-platform functionality and compatibility.</p>

                <h3 class="cardHeading">Full Stack Development</h3>
                <p class="text">A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both the front end and the back end of a website. The front end (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill sets. <br>
                Since full-stack developers are involved with all aspects of the development process, they must have expertise in both. A full-stack developer can work in-house or at a computer development company that engineers websites, software, and other components for other businesses.</p>
